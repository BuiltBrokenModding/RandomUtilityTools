# INFO
This log contains changes made to the project. Each entry contains changed made after the last version but before the number was changed. Any changes made after a number change are considered part of the next release. This is regardless if versions are still being released with that version number attached. 

If this is a problem, use exact build numbers to track changes. As each build logs the git-hash it was created from to better understand changes made.
